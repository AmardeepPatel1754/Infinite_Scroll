# Infinite_Scroll
The web application features an infinite scroll mechanism to load quotes from a MySQL database. The quotes are displayed in Bootstrap 5 cards, providing a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

# Technologies Used

* CSS (Bootstrap 5)
* JavaScript
* PHP
* MySQL

# Features
Infinite Scroll: The application dynamically fetches and displays quotes as the user scrolls down the page, creating a seamless and engaging experience.

# Database Connection
The PHP script (db-connect.php) establishes a connection to the MySQL database using PDO. Ensure that the database credentials are configured correctly.

# PHP Script for quotes
The quotes.php script handles the fetching of quotes from the database. It uses pagination to load quotes in batches, enhancing performance and user experience.

# Student Information
The student information is dynamically fetched using the me.php script, which connects to the server and retrieves the relevant details for display in the header.

# Note
The project is submitted for credit as part of the COMP 10260 course.
